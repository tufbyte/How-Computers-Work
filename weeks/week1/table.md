| Abstraction                        | A simplified representation or way of thinking about software or technology that emphasizes key details without the distraction of underlying complexity. | Abstract art (Modigliani), engineering diagrams, representing video as numbers or grids of pixels. | Capacitors, microchips, hard disks, optic fibers, CPU, RAM.                             | Numbers $\\rightarrow$ Pixels/Colors $\\rightarrow$ Sequence of Pictures (Video). | To understand and manage complex systems by focusing on essential features instead of billions of operations.                       | 1, 2   |
| Notional Machine                   | An abstraction of the actions or behavior of a computer system, thinking of it as a simplified machine that performs simple tasks.                        | Video player (timeline/playhead model), word processor editing, audio player functionality.        | Timeline, playhead, graphics card, network data, CPU, memory (RAM), hard disk.          | Action-based abstraction (behavioral layer).                                      | To enable effective use and control of software by capturing its essence without needing to understand code or hardware complexity. | 3, 4   |
| Interaction Model (CPU and Memory) | A notional machine for a computer as a whole where data is sent from memory to the CPU for processing and written back.                                   | Editing a sentence in a document, typing on a keyboard, playing a song.                            | CPU (Central Processing Unit), RAM (Random Access Memory), Hard Disk, Keyboard, Screen. | System-level hardware abstraction.                                                | To provide a graspable mental model of how different hardware components collaborate to perform tasks.                              | 4      |
| Computer Science                   | The science of computers, focused on understanding how they work and the ideas used to think about them.                                                  | Daily computer use, solving practical software problems, network protocols.                        | Computers, phones, tablets, software, network protocols.                                | Fundamental conceptual layer for understanding technology.                        | To help humans understand society and devices better, and to apply theoretical ideas to practical problems.                         | 5      |
| Direct Memory Access (DMA)         | A feature allowing data to be copied from memory to a device (like a sound card) without passing through the CPU.                                         | Audio player playback.                                                                             | Memory, Sound Card, CPU.                                                                | Hardware optimization/Architecture layer.                                         | To free up the CPU for other tasks while handling data-heavy processes like audio.                                                  | 4      |
