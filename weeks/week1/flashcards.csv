What do we call the tiny little squares that make up a computer picture?,Pixels (short for picture elements).
What are the three primary colours for light used in computer screens?,"Red, green, and blue."
"How is a single colour typically represented in a computer, based on the primary colours of light?","By three numbers indicating the amount of red, green, and blue."
"In the layers of abstraction for a video, a grid of pixels forms a picture, and a sequence of pictures forms a _____.",video
What do we call a set of abstractions where each one is simpler and more abstract than the one below it?,Layers of abstraction.
"What type of abstraction is needed to think about what a computer *does*, rather than just what it *represents*?","An abstraction of the actions of a computer, called a notional machine."
Term: Notional Machine,"A simplified, abstract model of how a piece of software or a computer works, focusing on its actions."
"In the notional machine of a video player, what term describes the indicator for the current position in the video?",The playhead.
The timeline and playhead together form a _____ _____ of a video player.,notional machine
What is the most important microchip in a computer that does all the calculations?,"The Central Processing Unit, or CPU."
What is the function of the Random Access Memory (RAM)?,It is where the computer stores all the data that it is currently working on.
The fundamental operation of a computer can be described as an interaction between which two components?,The CPU and memory (RAM).
Describe the basic data flow when editing a sentence in a word processor.,"The sentence is loaded from memory into the CPU, edited, and then written back to memory."
"When you first open a document, where is it transferred from and to?",It is transferred from the hard disk to RAM.
"When you type on a keyboard, the characters are sent to the CPU, which combines them with data from _____ and writes the result back to _____.","RAM, RAM"

What feature allows data to be copied from memory to a device like a sound card without involving the CPU?,Direct Memory Access (DMA).
What is the main benefit of using Direct Memory Access (DMA)?,It frees up the CPU to perform other tasks.
What is the primary reason notional machines are useful for understanding complex systems?,They are useful precisely because they are simple and easy to understand.
"The quizzes in the course are divided into two types, what are they?",Practice quizzes to help you learn and quizzes that count towards your final mark.
What must a student do to be well prepared for the coursework and final exam?,"Do all the exercises every week, including quizzes, peer reviews, and discussions."
"The core of a computer, which runs the instructions that make up computer programs, is the _____.",CPU (Central Processing Unit)
Why is it stated that just passively watching videos and reading the textbook is not enough to learn effectively?,Because the science of the brain shows we don't learn well passively and need to practise what we learn.
"In the abstraction of a digital picture, a pixel is a tiny square that has a _____.",colour
"When discussing layers of abstraction for a video, which abstraction is built directly upon the representation of data as numbers?",The abstraction of pixels and colours.
